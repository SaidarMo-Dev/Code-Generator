### Description 


This project is a code generator designed to automate the creation of data access and business layers for applications.
By providing a database name, user ID, and password, 
this generator creates structured code,
including CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and duplicated utility methods as needed.


### Features 

- Automatic CRUD Generation : Generate Create, Read, Update, Delete for each table.
- Layred Architecture : Separates code into Data Access Layer (DAL) and Business Layer (BL).
- Duplicated Utility Methods : Adds helper methods for common operations.
